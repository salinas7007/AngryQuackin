	<h4>Why We Are Called "Angry Quackin"</h4>
	<p>
	Because. Some things must be.

	<h4>OK, For Real: Why We Are Called "Angry Quackin"</h4>
	<p>
	Well, I currently am attending a junior college, that shall remain unnamed because I don't want to be sued. Or accused of libel, or anything like that. But anyway, guess what my school mascot is!! Are you thinking something strong? Something ferocious? Something intimidating and erudite at the same time? Well, you would be wrong.
	<br>
	Our mascot is a duck.
	<br>Nope. Not going to happen. I refuse to attend a school where the mascot is a duck. That's just . . . a duck? Really, people? Ugh. 
	<br>Enter the quackin. A <em>kraken</em> is a giant squid monster of the deep who is either slumbering or eating islands like pizza supremes. A <em>quackin</em> is a giant bird monster of the freshwater deep, a mutant waterfowl with the lurking, looming, voracious personality of the kraken. It is to be feared. </p>

	<h4>Who is The "We" Involved With This Site?</h4>
	<p>Currently me, Liz, and the evil but subdued-to-my-will website itself. I've named it Sidney Jane. Well, the website is called Adjective Quackin, but the files and the computers and the servers all blended it to one anthropomorphized conciousness is called Sidney Jane. And she's evil, don't forget. 
	<br>
	But yeah, that's who we are. Sidney Jane and I. Brawn and the brains of this operation.
