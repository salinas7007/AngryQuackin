Hello, random internet user! First, may I say welcome to the Angry Quackin forum! We open our metaphorical doors to all and are happy to add one more to the family. Unless you're a jerk. Then never mind.

This site is student designed, run, and content-generated, or whatever the verb for that concept would be. You can tell it's run by a brilliantly intelligent student because of how clever the writing is on the Home and About Us pages
	</p><br>

Brilliant or stupid, that's beside the point. The point is we're here to help. College is scary. College is stressful. When you add student loans, enrollment deadlines, and YOUR ENTIRE CAREER AND FUTURE AND THE FATE OF CIVILIZATION AS WE KNOW IT, it's the emotional equivalent of waking up one morning to find a python wrappped around your neck. Only in college, you're paying for that experience.

You'll have questions. A lot of them. Here is your place to ask them. From "wear do i find my studnt email???" to "What is the chess club like?", post 'em here. Someone's been in the same boat you were, or at least can throw you a life jacket. We're here to help each other out.
	</p><br>
	<p>
That said, please feel free to start discussions as well. List off the microwaves around the campus. The best places to study. Great restaurants around campus. Stay within our policies, and we'd love to hear what you have to say!

Enjoy your stay!

	This is still in testing stages and under construction, so it will change often and dramatically. So, for example, don't be surprised to come back and find the page bright pink with glittery unicorns prancing all over.
