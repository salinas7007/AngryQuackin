By joining the forum, you agree to submit to our policies, K? K.<br><br>
1) We can and will delete whatever posts, replies, and users we see fit.<br>
2) I can acccidentally delete posts, replies, and users for no other reason than I pressed the wrong button, bc I'm smart that way. <br>
3) Sidney Jane will probably get out of control and delete or break something. You will not yell at me for that or I will cry. Please don't make me cry. :( <br>
4) I don't vouch for any of the information posted here. None of it. Zilch. Nada. The only people responsible for the accuracy of the info is the person posting it. Follow it at your own risk. But I'll try to vet some of it. After all, what use is a forum where nothing's accurate? <br>
5) Please don't post anything that is no bueno--foul language, PG-13+ topics, harassment, rudeness, or generally obnoxious behaviour <br>
6) Posts and information will be vetted. Somewhat. Kinda. OK, when I'm supposed to be studying and am not. Which actually might be often<br>
